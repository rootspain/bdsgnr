### New
- **What's new** window on the first start of a new version; open it again from Help ▸ What's new.
- **Usage statistics** in the settings: the most used buttons, menus and hot keys, flags switched on and
  straight back off, and the commands followed by a long pause.
- The timing line stays in the project and remembers its holes: moving or editing the line reprograms
  the delays of those holes.
- Timing line window redesigned: preview of the times on the plan, summary of intervals and the vibration window.
- Visibility tab: two columns and new labels — bearing, temperature, deck masses, deck sequence,
  detonator ID; dip and actual tracks, grade point, deviation, burden marker, MWD profile.
- First movement window redesigned; it opens with everything in view.

### Changed
- The hole number is shown in blue at the top right, the firing order at the top left.
- New projects show collars, charge columns, hole numbers and the firing order by default.
- The "Tracks" button is now "Depths"; "Charge 3D" shows the charge columns also without depth lines.
- Visualization window: the scrub bar shrinks with the window, speeds x1, x2 and x4.
- The Row tool ends the row at the second point; Shift+click adds bends.
- Opening the timing line with electronic detonators shows the hole order instead of the hole number.

### Fixed
- Timing lines from older files reprogram their holes when moved.
- First movement arrows no longer stack with another analysis on the plan.
